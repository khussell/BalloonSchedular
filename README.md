The Magical Hot Air Balloon Schedular:

What?
In this application you will be able to see schedules for hot air balloon rides. The schedules will be updated with next balloon depature time and minutes until that departure time at every page reload. You will also be able to add your own balloon to the schedule.

How?
Along with HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, this application was made using the Firebase Realtime Database API and utilizing Moment.js library for timing.
